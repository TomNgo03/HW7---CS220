## Overview

The Weather App is a simple web application that leverages TypeScript to fetch weather data from a weather API. By providing a location, users can retrieve current weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The application offers an intuitive interface to display the retrieved weather information in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- Weather Information: Fetches and displays the current weather data based on the user's specified location.
- Location Autocomplete: Provides autocomplete suggestions for location input to enhance user experience and accuracy.
- Error Handling: Handles errors gracefully and displays appropriate messages when weather data cannot be fetched or the location is invalid.

## Installation
